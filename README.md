# List of domains with adult content
This list compiles a variety of domains related to adult content, primarily focusing on pornographic websites. Instead of creating another list from scratch, it aggregates the excellent work done by others into a comprehensive compilation.

## ATTENTION
> [!CAUTION]
> The repository has undergone extensive validation of domains with careful DNS checks to minimize the potential for false results. Nevertheless, it's crucial to acknowledge that circumstances can evolve swiftly. **Please be aware that this list does not come with any guarantee of accuracy. Exercise caution, especially for critical applications.**

## Live search this list online
> [!TIP]
> This list is too large to view and search directly in a web browser. For easier searching, use the following option: https://bon-appetit.github.io/domain-search/

## Purpose

| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| `block.txt` | Compilation of all domains aggregated from various blacklist sources, with syntax verification and duplicates eliminated. Specific domains, such as those from whitelists, are omitted. |
| `pass.txt` | Consolidates all whitelisted domains into a single file, with each domain undergoing syntax checking for uniform verification. |

**You can find a dedicated README file with more information about the included files in the `blacklist` and `whitelist` directories.**

## Something to add or correct?
If you have a domain to add or remove, feel free to open an issue to share your request. You can also submit a pull request with your changes. For whitelisting, please include the domain in `whitelist/wl-custom.txt` or provide a URL to your own whitelist file. For blacklisting, do the same with `blacklist/bl-custom.txt` or a URL to your own blacklist file. Thank you!
