# 🔞 List of domains with adult content
This list compiles a variety of domains related to adult content, primarily focusing on pornographic websites. Instead of creating yet another list from scratch, it aggregates the excellent work done by others into one big list.

## 👀 What's new?
For details about updates and changes to this repository, take a look at the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md).

## 🔍 Live search
> [!TIP]
> This list is too large to view directly on GitHub and searching through it in your browser isn’t very convenient. To make things easier, you can use a sleek and user-friendly interface to search the list. Try it out: https://bon-appetit.github.io/domain-search/

## ⁉️ Purpose of files

| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| `block.txt` | Compilation of all domains aggregated from various blacklist sources, with syntax verification and duplicates eliminated. Specific domains, such as those from whitelists, are omitted. |
| `pass.txt` | Consolidates all whitelisted domains into a single file, with each domain undergoing syntax checking for uniform verification. |

## 📝 Something to add or correct?
If you have a domain to add or remove, feel free to open an issue. You can also submit a pull request with your changes. For whitelisting, please include the domain in `whitelist/wl-custom.txt` or provide a URL to your own whitelist file. For blacklisting, do the same with `blacklist/bl-custom.txt` or a URL to your own blacklist file.
