# Whitelist

## Purpose

| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| `wl-sources.txt` | Contains a list of website links to domains to be kept off the block list to avoid mistakenly blocking legitimate websites. It may be modified to add new source URLs. However, existing URLs should not be removed without a valid reason, such as excessive spam or the source becoming obsolete. |
| `wl-sources.csv` | It is automatically generated on a regular basis and should not be modified. It provides a "human-friendly" way to review sources, including additional metadata. |
| `wl-custom.txt` | Custom whitelist of domains to be excluded from the block list. |
| `/external_format` | Directory of specialized whitelist files for organizing external data or domains into a specific structure for background processes. |
