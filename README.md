# 🔞 List Of Domains With Adult Content

This list compiles a variety of domains related to adult content, primarily focusing on pornographic websites. Instead of creating yet another list from scratch, it aggregates the excellent work done by others into one big list.

> [!CAUTION]
> ⚠️ **Important Notice – Excessive Traffic and File Path Change**
>
> Due to unexpectedly high levels of automated traffic (exceeding 1PB/day), GitHub has issued a warning that this repository may be temporarily disabled. The spike appears to be caused by external services directly referencing `block.txt`.
>
> As a precaution, the original `block.txt` file has been **deleted** and **replaced** with a new file, `please-slow-down.txt`, to reduce automated requests. If you are a legitimate user, please refer to the updated file path in the repository. Note that this is a temporary measure, and a proper, permanent solution will be implemented as soon as possible. Until then, automatic updates will also be paused to avoid any conflicts with the files.

> [!TIP]

## ⁉️ Purpose Of Files

| **Filename** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| `block.txt` | Compilation of all domains aggregated from various blacklist sources, with syntax verification and duplicates eliminated. Specific domains, such as those from whitelists, are omitted. |
| `pass.txt` | Consolidates all whitelisted domains into a single file, with each domain undergoing syntax checking for uniform verification. |

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

### ❌ No Guarantee

We do not guarantee the list is 100% accurate, complete, or up to date. Use it at your own discretion. Some sites may slip through, and some sites included here may eventually become non-pornographic.

### ⚖️ Local Laws & Definitions

Definitions of “pornographic” or “sexually explicit” vary by jurisdiction. We apply a broad, common-sense definition aligned with typical “adult content” standards. Users are responsible for ensuring they comply with local regulations or corporate policies.

### 🛡️ Usage & Liability

This is not a definitive or comprehensive list of all adult domains. By using it, you acknowledge that false positives (innocent domains being blocked) and false negatives (porn sites not yet included) may occur. You assume all risks associated with over-blocking or under-blocking. The maintainers are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of this list.
